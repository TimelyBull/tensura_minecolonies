# Key Decisions

## Architecture

**Standalone integration mod, not KubeJS scripts**
User preference. A compiled mod gives full access to both mods' Java APIs and
is not constrained by what KubeJS exposes.

**Target: NeoForge 1.21.1, JDK 21**
Matches the BigBigSlime server environment.

## Dependency management

**Manual jars in `libs/` — not Maven/CurseForge Maven**
MineColonies has a "no 3rd party sharing" policy on CurseForge, which breaks
CurseMaven. Jars are sourced manually and placed in `libs/`.

**`libs/` is NOT committed to git**
Licensing: we do not redistribute other mods' binaries. Exact versions are
tracked in `docs/dependencies.md` instead so the build can be reproduced.

**ManasCore sub-modules extracted from the parent jar**
ManasCore uses NeoForge's JARs-in-a-JAR (JiJ) system — 10 sub-module jars are
embedded inside `manascore-neoforge-4.0.0.2.jar`. NeoForge extracts and loads
them at runtime, but `javac` cannot see inside nested JARs. Sub-modules are
extracted to `libs/` and added as `compileOnly` so the compiler can resolve
their classes (e.g. `Changeable`). They do NOT need `localRuntime` because the
parent jar already handles runtime loading via JiJ.

## Event system

**Use `TensuraEntityEvents.NAMING_EVENT.register(...)`, NOT `@SubscribeEvent`**
`NAMING_EVENT` is an Architectury `Event<>`, not a NeoForge bus event.
`@SubscribeEvent` will silently do nothing. Registration must be done via the
`.register(lambda)` method on the event field itself.

## Feature design

**Option B: goblin stays a Tensura subordinate AND becomes a MineColonies citizen**
Option A (convert the entity to a citizen, losing Tensura state) was rejected
because it removes all Tensura functionality. Option B keeps both roles active.
Possible future addition: a management menu to handle conflicts between the two
role systems separately.
