# Tensura MineColonies Integration

A NeoForge 1.21.1 mod that bridges **Tensura: Reincarnated** and **MineColonies**. The first feature is allowing a named Tensura goblin to join a MineColonies colony as a citizen.

The developer is a beginner — explain concepts clearly, avoid jargon without explanation, and prefer simple and explicit code over clever abstractions.

## Project planning

Planning documents live in `docs/` and should be kept current as work progresses:

- [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) — milestone checklist and feature tiers; update task status as work completes
- [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) — record of key architectural and design decisions with reasoning; add new entries when a non-obvious choice is made
- [docs/dependencies.md](docs/dependencies.md) — exact jar versions in `libs/` and confirmed registry IDs; update when new deps are added

## Known housekeeping debt

The MDK default package (`com.example.examplemod`) and class names (`ExampleMod`, `ExampleModClient`, `Config`) have not been renamed yet. When writing new code, start new classes in a proper package like `com.tensura.minecolonies` and migrate the existing files when convenient. Do not block feature work on this rename.

## Current feature status (Milestone 3 vertical slice)

The "two bodies, one identity" design is largely implemented end-to-end.
See `docs/roadmap.md` for stage-by-stage detail; `docs/decisions.md` for
the design rationale and design-choice history.

**Complete:**
- Stage 1b — pending pool (goblins named before any colony exists are
  promoted on `ColonyCreatedModEvent`).
- Stage A — naming creates `CitizenData` + count without spawning a body.
- Stage B — sneak-right-click send-to-colony swap; full item transfer.
- Stage C1 — `/summongoblin <name>` command brings the goblin back.
- Stage C2a/b — keybind-opened roster Screen (default `G`), two-way
  toggle, ConfirmCollapseScreen for the forced-collapse overspend prompt.
- Stage D — death hooks (`LivingDeathEvent` + `CitizenDiedModEvent`).
- Stage D2 — magicule cost gate (target.EP × 0.25), shared chokepoint.
- Stage D3 — stat sync (bump destination max attributes, then absolute
  copy of aura/magicule/spiritualHealth/HP plus flat copy of counters
  and destiny flags).
- Stage E — Tensura `MagicCircle` visuals (SPACE variant, 3× size,
  spinning), 2-second delay, sink-and-rise animations with X/Z lock and
  fall-damage prevention, refund-on-abort.

- Stage F — goblin renderer for the in-colony citizen body. Tagged
  citizens render through `GoblinCitizenRenderer` (extends
  `LivingEntityRenderer<AbstractEntityCitizen, PlayerModel<…>>`) with
  per-citizen variant appearance — gender, skin, face, hair, hair
  color, conditional bandages — and the right scale + clothing for
  hobgoblins vs base goblins. Plus `HumanoidArmorLayer` and
  `ItemInHandLayer` so the citizen renders armor + weapon. Baby
  goblins propagate as child citizens. Untagged citizens fall through
  to MineColonies' default render. See roadmap.md Stage F (F1–F7).
- Stage G — race system foundation. `Race` enum + `Races` registry,
  sealed `RaceVariantData` (Goblin and Orc variants), `RaceTag` with
  the race discriminator, race-aware naming/send/summon. Orc
  rendering via a per-citizen shadow-`OrcEntity` pool fed to Tensura's
  own `OrcRenderer`, with animation driven by mirroring the citizen's
  walkAnimation/pose/sprint state (HARD RULE: shadow never `tick()`).
  Per-orc variants set on the shadow each frame; Tensura's accessory
  layers read them automatically. Equipment slots mirrored from the
  citizen to the shadow. Orc lord and orc disaster blocked from the
  pipeline (separate EntityTypes; per-tier shadow pools deferred).
  See roadmap.md Stage G (G1–G4).
- Stage B — race-aware population spawn. `ColonyRaceConfigSavedData`
  tracks each colony's chosen race plus a `pendingChoice` set.
  `CitizenAddedModEvent(INITIAL)` interception discards MC's
  about-to-spawn citizen + spawns a wild Tensura mob of the colony's
  chosen race instead (pending colonies suppress growth entirely
  until choice). Town-hall race-picker modal opens on
  `ColonyCreatedModEvent` (parent-stacking + 1-tick defer to capture
  MC's town hall UI as parent). Re-engagement on right-click or
  login. MC's auto-sent "colony_founded" / "colony_reactivated" chat
  messages suppressed via Mixin; replayed by our race-picker handler
  on DEFAULT pick, race-specific flavour text on GOBLIN/ORC.
- Stage H — envoy system (H1-H3b, all four sub-stages). Diplomatic
  emissaries from COLONIST / GOBLIN / ORC factions periodically arrive
  at each colony offering to add their race to its spawn set.
  `EnvoyTag` NeoForge attachment marks the entity; per-race entities
  are GoblinEntity / OrcEntity / `VisitorCitizen` (registered via
  `VisitorManager` so the visitor-handler's discard-on-zero-citizen-id
  doesn't kill it). 15-block roam radius via `restrictTo`. Custom
  `EnvoyDialogueScreen` with race-flavoured copy (chosen over MC's
  `IInteractionResponseHandler` reuse — that interface is hard-bound
  to `ICitizenData`). Accept adds the race to the spawn set,
  marks the race permanently envoy-locked. Per-second scheduler with
  3-day post-resolve cooldown. Unlock conditions: COLONIST = colony age
  ≥ 3 days, GOBLIN = ≥ 3 named goblins, ORC = ≥ 25 citizens. Gamerule
  `tensuraMaxNonColonistEnvoys` (default 4) caps non-colonist races
  per player. Kill-gate (Stage H3b): killing an unaccepted race resets
  its condition for every colony you own, with per-shape semantics
  (timer / cumulative / current-value). Orc lord / orc disaster
  excluded from the kill-gate. Full as-built record in
  `docs/envoy-system.md`. Debug commands: `/spawnenvoy`,
  `/envoystate`, `/envoyforce`, `/envoyresetcooldown`.
- Stage I — Lizardman + Dwarf races, citizen-skill profiles,
  subordinate trade tab (4 sub-stages, all landed).
  - **I1**: `RaceSkillProfile` per-Skill bias system layered on MC's
    randomised init. Applied ONCE at naming-to-citizen; normal MC
    progression continues untouched. Per-race profiles defined for
    all five members (ORC tanky, GOBLIN flat, LIZARDMAN speed,
    DWARF craftsmanship, COLONIST baseline).
  - **I2 Lizardman**: GeckoLib path, reuses orc shadow-entity render
    pattern. 18-byte variant record. Envoy unlock ≥15 citizens.
    Yellow nameplate.
  - **I3 Dwarf**: Vanilla biped path, reuses goblin PlayerModel +
    overlay-layer pattern. 29-byte variant record (25-byte trailing
    `float scale`; 25-byte legacy decodes default to 0.9375f).
    Three wrinkles solved: (1) `can_be_named` datapack tag merge
    (dwarf isn't in Tensura's tag); (2) SCALE attribute dropped from
    the citizen body entirely — scaling is renderer-only, base
    `0.9375f` × per-citizen captured `Attributes.SCALE` from the
    source wild dwarf (which Tensura randomises in [0.7, 1.0] biased
    low), so each citizen dwarf matches the wild dwarf it was named
    from; hitbox stays full citizen size; (3) lazy "texture proxy"
    `DwarfEntity` for Tensura's static texture helpers. Gold
    nameplate. Envoy unlock PLACEHOLDER (≥30 citizens AND a Miner's
    Hut built); real conditions deferred-content.
  - **I4 Trade tab** (now CITIZEN-side — see post-Stage-I polish
    below): Yellow "Trade" button for named goblin / lizardman /
    dwarf bodies. Server opens vanilla Merchant screen. Profession /
    merchant level / persisted offers / gossips all round-trip via
    Tensura's NBT. Trade screen viewable 24h; stock refresh fires
    once at dawn (per-dimension `getDayTime()/24000` rollover) via
    `tickDawnRestock` calling each merchant's `restock()`. The
    button was originally on the subordinate's `HumanoidMainScreen`;
    that handler still exists in the source tree but is no longer
    registered. The current implementation is described in the
    "Post-Stage-I polish — trade button on citizen body" section.

**Stage K — earned-race skill partition + Orc removed from picker:**
- STARTERS (Colonist, Goblin) — picker-available, flat baselines, unchanged.
- EARNED (Orc, Dwarf, Lizardman) — envoy-only; skill biases re-partitioned so each owns a distinct lane (orc=physical, dwarf=mental/craft, lizardman=precision+mystic).
- Orc kept: HIGH Strength/Athletics/Stamina, LOW Knowledge/Intelligence/Creativity.
- Dwarf re-aligned: HIGH Knowledge/Intelligence/Creativity (Intelligence in place of Dexterity), LOW Athletics/Strength/Agility (Strength added).
- Lizardman expanded: HIGH Agility/Dexterity/Focus + **Mana** (only race covering Mana → unlocks Healer/Alchemist/Enchanter at race-bias parity), LOW Strength/Stamina. 4↑/2↓ asymmetry kept (Mana is a narrow gate).
- Adaptability stays starter-only (goblin's mild positive is the only earned/starter signal on it).
- `RacePickerScreen`: Orc button removed, two-button centered layout (Default / Goblin), description reframed; closing line points players to diplomacy for the other races.
- `Networking.RaceChoicePayload.CHOICE_ORC = 2` and server handler case retained as defensive paths (legacy in-flight payloads, cheap re-enable). `/setcolonyrace` admin command unaffected. Orc fully exists; just not a STARTER.

**Stage J2 — condition-dependent envoy dialogue:**
- `EnvoyCondition` enum (7 values, 1-byte bitmask) captures which alternatives were satisfied at spawn.
- Captured per envoy in `captureMetConditions`; persisted on `EnvoyTag.conditionMask` (NBT byte) and threaded through `OpenEnvoyDialoguePayload` to the client.
- Dialogue text = `base + " " + snippet(member, condA) + " " + snippet(member, condB)` ... — each snippet a complete sentence in the race's voice, joined with a space, no inter-snippet references. No combinatorial explosion.
- Race voices (rewritten to Tensura canon — envoys are generic race reps who revere the player as a powerful protector-ruler): goblin humble-eager-grateful, orc dutiful-solemn-with-atonement, lizardman proud-formal-but-sincere, dwarf gruff-hearty-craftsman, colonist polite-neutral (left as-is; not a Tensura race, no canon profile).
- COUNT / TIMER alternatives DO get snippets — keeps early-game (single-condition) dialogue from feeling flat.
- `EnvoyDialogueScreen` panel grows dynamically to fit the wrapped body line count (clamped to screen height − 20).
- Backward-compat: legacy envoys with no `condMask` decode as mask 0 → base-only dialogue.
- Accept / decline TEXT is also condition-aware for DWARF + TRUE_HERO / TRUE_DEMON_LORD (title acknowledged in the parting line); other races stay flat. HERO precedes DEMON_LORD when both captured. Accept/Decline server mechanics unchanged.
- Post-Stage-J2 polish: every base body and snippet shortened (~half length).
- Canon-voice rewrite (latest): goblin/orc/lizardman/dwarf dialogue reworded to match each race's Tensura voice with envoys revering the player. Functional condition references kept verbatim ("Orc Disaster", "Ifrit", "true demon lord / hero", dwarven village, colony size/age, "twenty days"); invented org/character names ("Elder", "Marsh-Tribe", "Holds", "council", "chroniclers") removed; neutral reverent address ("great one"). Colonist lines unchanged.

**Stage J — deferred-content envoy conditions (eligibility + kill-gate, no dialogue yet):**
- ORC alternative: Orc Disaster defeated (per-player, permanent flag, immune to all resets).
- LIZARDMAN alternative: Ifrit defeated (per-player, cleared on lizardman kill).
- DWARF alternatives (any one qualifies, in addition to the existing 30-citizens+Miner placeholder): 20 in-game days no owner death (per-colony, −10 day penalty on dwarf kill), dwarven-village entered (per-player flag, cleared on dwarf kill), true demon lord (gated by per-player disable flag), true hero (same shape as demon lord).
- Detection: `LivingDeathEvent` on OrcDisasterEntity / IfritEntity / owning ServerPlayer; structure-bbox poll per scheduler tick; live `IExistence` read; `LivingEntityUseItemEvent.Finish` on `ResetScrollItem` with `RESET_ALL` for the demon-lord/hero disable clear; status-currently-false fallback in the scheduler.
- Storage extended on `ColonyRaceConfigSavedData` — one per-colony Long map + five `Set<UUID>` per-player flag sets; NBT-persistent, backward-compatible.
- Stage 2 (condition-dependent dialogue copy) deferred.

**Post-Stage-I polish:**
- Subordinate sneak-right-click send removed — roster menu (G) is
  now the only send path. Envoy right-click branch still active.
- Dwarf facial hair: dedicated `DwarfFacialHairLayer` (vanilla
  `HumanoidModel`, not `PlayerModel`) — Tensura's
  `FACIAL_HAIR_LAYER` is the only dwarf overlay built from
  `HumanoidModel.createMesh`, so the generic PlayerModel-based
  `DwarfOverlayLayer` was failing the bake and silently dropping
  the beard.

**Post-Stage-I polish — trade button on citizen body:**
- Trade button moved from the subordinate's HumanoidMainScreen to
  the CITIZEN info window. Subordinate-side handler retained but
  unregistered.
- **Now a native BlockUI tab** (was a vanilla overlay — superseded).
  A single `ScreenEvent.Init.Post` hook on `AbstractWindowCitizen`
  (every citizen sub-page) adds a `ButtonImage` tab reusing MC's own
  `tab_left_side3.png` (32×26 at x=0) + a 20×20 icon
  (`tensura_minecolonies:textures/gui/modules/trade.png`) at
  `(5, tabY+3)`, in the first free slot at/after `familyTab`
  (170→196→222, reading `jobTab`/`debugTab` visibility). Routed like
  MC's tabs: `setHandler(window)` + `registerButton(id, runnable)`
  firing the unchanged `OpenCitizenTradePayload`. The earlier vanilla-
  `Button` overlay (`Render.Post` + `MouseButtonPressed.Pre` +
  `getGuiScaledWidth` anchoring) was removed; the off-window /
  vanilla-widget blockers don't apply to an in-window BlockUI child.
  See decisions.md "SUPERSEDED — trade button is now a native BlockUI
  tab". Only GOBLIN/LIZARDMAN/DWARF race citizens get the tab (not orc).
- Trade now works directly in CITIZEN form. The old "summon them
  back first" advisory is gone. `handleOpenCitizenTrade`
  reconstructs a transient `TensuraMerchantEntity` via
  `EntityType.create(identity.entitySnapshot, level)`, positions it
  on the citizen (bookkeeping only — never `addFreshEntity`), sets
  the trading player and opens the standard MerchantMenu. The
  reconstructed entity is held in `TRANSIENT_MERCHANTS` keyed by
  player UUID; a new `@SubscribeEvent onPlayerContainerClose`
  saves `merchant.save(freshTag)` back to `identity.entitySnapshot`
  via `saved.updateEntitySnapshot` and drops the session. Re-entry
  is blocked while a trade is open. No world-side merchant ever
  appears; the trade UI is the only surface.
- Dawn restock extended to citizen-form snapshots.
  `tickDawnRestock` now runs two passes per dimension: (A) the
  original live-subordinate pass for SUBORDINATE-mode identities
  whose wild form is in the world, and (B) a new snapshot pass for
  IN_COLONY-mode identities — reconstruct merchant via
  `EntityType.create(snapshot)`, call `restock()`, save back to the
  snapshot. Without pass B, the citizen-form trade button would
  drain offers and never refill. Pass B skips any identity that
  has an active `TRANSIENT_MERCHANTS` session to avoid racing the
  close-event persist hook clobbering the restocked snapshot — those
  catch up on the next dawn.
- Summon-time skin fix. `applyVariantToMob(LivingEntity mob, RaceTag tag)`
  now runs in `summonGoblin` immediately after `EntityType.create`
  succeeds — stamps each race-specific appearance field
  (`setGender/setSkin/.../setVariant/...`) from the citizen's
  current `RaceTag` onto the freshly reconstructed wild mob. The
  NBT round-trip via `readAdditionalSaveData` was usually correct
  but the snapshot is older than the RaceTag (snapshot captured at
  first send; RaceTag refreshed on every send), so drift produced
  the reported "summoned mob's skin doesn't match the citizen"
  symptom. Per-race apply methods: `applyGoblinVariant`,
  `applyOrcVariant`, `applyLizardmanVariant`,
  `applyDwarfVariant` (the dwarf one also restores the per-mob
  `Attributes.SCALE`).
- `tensuraMaxNonColonistEnvoys` gamerule default bumped 2 → 4.
  Existing worlds keep their stored value; new worlds start at 4.

**Citizen merchant shops — native tab, restock, leveling, cosmetic
profession (latest):**
- **Trade trigger is a native BlockUI tab** in the citizen window's left
  strip (`CitizenTradeButtonHandler`, `Init.Post` on `AbstractWindowCitizen`),
  reusing MC's `tab_left_side3.png` + a shipped `trade.png` icon
  (dark-brown arrows matched to MC's icon palette). Added at the bottom
  of the z-order so it tucks behind the content panel like MC's own tabs.
  Replaces the old vanilla overlay. GOBLIN / LIZARDMAN / DWARF only.
- **Refresh on open + dawn.** `handleOpenCitizenTrade` calls
  `restockIfPossible()` before showing trades (sold-out trades refill
  without summon+resend), on top of the dawn pass-B restock.
- **Trade level-ups apply citizen-side.** The transient citizen merchant
  never runs `customServerAiStep`, so the trade close hook
  (`onPlayerContainerClose`) now calls `applyPendingMerchantLevelUps`
  (reflective `while shouldIncreaseLevel() (≤ lvl 5): increaseMerchantCareer()`),
  which APPENDS the next tier's trades on reaching the XP threshold. New
  trades show on reopen.
- **Profession is COSMETIC ONLY.** Goblin/lizardman/dwarf each override
  `getPossibleTrades()` with intrinsic, profession-independent trades, so
  the citizen profession pass (`tickCitizenProfessions`, DWARF-only) sets
  a villager profession purely to drive the dwarf profession-clothes
  render (`DwarfProfessionLayer`) and NEVER touches trades. A dwarf gains
  the cosmetic profession from a nearby job-site block, anchored to that
  block (`RaceIdentity.jobSitePos`) so it doesn't flicker as the citizen
  wanders, and loses it when the block is broken. Goblin/lizardman shops
  are byte-identical across the wild → named → colony stages. See
  decisions.md "CORRECTION — citizen merchant professions are COSMETIC
  ONLY".

**Reputation system v1 (foundational spine — latest):**
- Per-colony standing 0–100 (default 50 NEUTRAL) with derived tiers;
  `ReputationManager` is the LOCKED sole-door API every future feature
  (crime/raids/assassins/reclaim/trades) reads and writes through —
  `modifyReputation(colony, amount, ReputationReason)` is the only
  mutator. Per-player (ruler) store plumbed but driven by no v1 mover.
- Movers: boss kill +10 (Orc Disaster/Ifrit, nearest colony), building
  built/upgraded +2, citizen attacked −5 (5 s combo dedupe), citizen
  killed by player −15 (via `LivingDeathEvent`, NOT
  `CitizenDiedModEvent` — that event lacks the killer). Envoys exempt.
- Visible: roster header tier line ("Loyal · 72", tier-coloured),
  envoy-dialogue tone sentence by tier (NEUTRAL appends nothing),
  `/reputation` + `/reputation set` debug commands.
- Records: `docs/reputation-system.md` (as-built),
  `docs/decisions.md` → "Reputation system v1" (locked decisions).

**Assassin system v1+v2 (latest):**
- Mistreated colonies (rep tier below WARY + avg happiness < 4) build a
  chosen citizen's determination (+1/day): LURKING at 2 (Great-Sage-only
  red nameplate; defused if the colony recovers), ARMED at 4 → strikes
  at the owner's first vulnerability (low HP / sleeping / no armor /
  festival start / just-prestiged). The Tensura body manifests as
  "<name>, the Betrayer": ×3 HP, ×2.5 spiritual, ×1.15 speed, ×2.5
  damage, purple boss bar, town-hall tether (32/48), colony cold-shoulder
  (trade + envoys). v2: killing the PLAYER steals half their base max EP
  (reversible stable-id modifiers; slay the boss to reclaim — offline
  reclaim on login) and copies their best skills (1/5/10/≤10 by type);
  resistances work passively, a curated whitelist of actives is cast
  every 5 s (CASTABLE_PRESS/TOGGLE sets in Assassins — extend via smoke
  testing). One assassin per colony EVER; `enableAssassins` config
  kill-switch; `/assassin state|arm|strike|defuse`. Record:
  docs/assassin-system.md.

**Reputation extras:** daily happiness drift toward a resting point
  (piecewise: h≥2 → 30+5×(h−2); punitive below 2 → down to 10 at h0;
  15%/day capped ±2), weighted buildings (amenities +4 / basic +2).

**Barrier/raid expansion (post-v1):** 4 Barrier Core tiers + Magicule
  Storage overflow blocks + square wall render w/ layers 1–3
  (DL/Hero-gated) + core menu; raids have difficulty LEVELS 1–3 scaled
  to colony strength (EP-primary, ×1.15 budget); hostile-spawn
  prevention inside fueled barriers. Records: docs/raid-system.md.

**Rival-colony arc — Stage A (settlement generation; latest):**
- `RivalColonies` + `Settlement` + `SettlementSavedData`: per-faction
  themed faux-towns built instantly from MineColonies schematics
  (`StructurePacks.getBlueprintFuture` → `CreativeBuildingStructureHandler
  .loadAndPlaceStructureWithRotation`). Physical factions + packs:
  Luminous=Ancient Athens, Dwargon=Stalactite Caves, Falmuth=Fortress,
  Shizu=Pagoda, Leon=Caledonia, Otherworlders=Space Wars, Jura=Jungle
  Treehouse. Abstract (no settlement): Tempest, Carrion, Milim, Clayman.
  Wild/colony split via `SettlementMode` config (ALL/SOME/NONE, default
  SOME) — colony = settlement + FactionMarkTag boss; wild = unmarked
  boss alone. Our-own scheduler generation pass (not vanilla world-gen),
  rare/capped/tunable; `rivalNaturalGeneration` toggle. Debug:
  `/rivalcolony spawn|wild <faction>` + `list`. All behind
  factionSystemEnabled. Stages B–E extend the Settlement record's
  reserved seams. Records: docs/rival-colony-investigation.md (Stage A
  as-built). ⚠ Tracked: confirm the getBlueprintFuture pack key (display
  name) in-game on first spawn.

**Barrier/diplomacy/Covenant batch:**
- Barrier tiers cumulative + distinct colors: T1 wall (traps
  inside-mobs), T2 +heal, T3/T4 +eject. Drain reworked to
  attackDamage × (EP × BARRIER_DRAIN_EP_MULTIPLIER 0.002).
- Magicule Storage recipes (silver corners + magisteel cross + chest;
  ingot/crystal climb by tier). New items: Masterwork Forging Core,
  Apito Nectar, Apito's Jelly, Drago Nova.
- Named race-citizens get a 0.5 StaticHappinessModifier (acquisition
  method isn't stored; naming is the only intake today).
- COVENANT tier (NONE→OPEN→PACT→COVENANT): damped post-PACT gain,
  threshold 95, per-faction milestone deal forges it. Rewards: Dwargon/
  Carrion grinders, Tempest/Jura training split, Milim Drago Nova
  (Sage warning + non-DL/hero death), Falmuth 2× ally support, Luminous
  3 spirits (if none), Clayman intel + summon. Reroll button (4 high
  crystals). Faction row shows real tier/relations-state.
  Records: docs/diplomacy.md (Covenant batch), docs/raid-system.md
  (barrier batch), docs/future-ideas.md (boss-colony chance).

**Diplomacy Stage 4 (the mending ritual — diplomacy COMPLETE):**
- A foreclosed faction (diplomacy-closed, e.g. the Orc Disaster kill)
  offers exactly ONE deal: the Rite of Atonement (`MendingRite`
  Requirement; `MENDING_DEALS` per faction). Price: 32 diamonds + the
  SACRIFICE of the player's strongest named subordinate (EP ≥ 10 000,
  body present — identity + both bodies removed permanently).
  Fulfilment fires the stubbed `reopenDiplomacy`, sets standing to 25
  (WARY — rebuild from almost nothing, relations NONE, re-court
  normally). Repeatable on re-foreclosure. Tunables on DealSpec
  (MENDING_*) + DiplomacyManager.MENDING_REOPEN_STANDING.

**Diplomacy Stage 3 (rewards + ally raid-support + coupling):**
- Rewards: PACT factions never send lore events; alliance buffs
  (refresh-style MobEffects, `ALLIANCE_BUFFS` map); daily caravan goods
  (`FACTION_GOODS` + Claim Caravan, 1-day cooldown); "Caravan Home"
  teleport perk (any PACT, half-day cooldown); the spare-Orc-Disaster
  standing gift (Clayman ≥ 60, once ever, spawned UNMARKED → zero
  faction consequences).
- Ally raid-support (⚠ unplayed balance seam — constants on
  TensuraRaids): every raid start (generic + lore) spawns PACT-faction
  fighters — passive Tensura mobs (dwarf/lizardman/goblin), AllyTag,
  steered onto raiders by the inverted dual-write, poofed at
  resolution. ALLY_SUPPORT_PER_PACT 2, +1/10 standing over 80, max
  4/faction, total cap 8; uuids persist on the event NBT.
- Coupling: majin flip downgrades Holy-bloc PACT → OPEN (persisted
  side-watch); marked-boss-kill → standing crash → relations shatter
  confirmed working via the existing Layer-1 + collapse chain.
  Records: docs/diplomacy.md (Stage 3 as-built), docs/future-ideas.md
  (sieges, the 10+ faction quest catalog, race-citizen lending).

**Diplomacy Stage 2 (lending + flavored deals + fuller UI):**
- `LendCitizens` Requirement variant: VANILLA colonists only (the
  (colonyId, citizenId) RaceIdentity filter — race-citizen lending is
  a documented follow-on). Accept → `WindowLendPicker` (eligible
  citizens + skill levels, exact-count Send) → snapshots into
  `ActiveDeal.lentCitizens` NBT + `removeCivilian` (workforce drops) →
  AWAITING_PAYOFF with a time-% bar → `resurrectCivilianData(resetId
  =true)` at the town hall + `incrementLevel` + reward. Edge cases:
  colony deleted → fallback to any owned colony, else the deal WAITS
  (citizens never lost); reload-safe by construction; collapse
  mid-lend returns them untrained first.
- Faction-flavored deal tables (`DealSpec.FACTION_DEALS`): Dwargon
  craft/industry, Tempest/Jura community/learning, Holy bloc HARD
  (library L5 / 32 diamonds / barracks), Milim/Carrion offerings;
  Clayman + aloof factions offer nothing. Offers draw from the
  faction's table (tier-gated; lends only offered when staffable).
- UI: faction rows show running-deal % ("deal 47%"); lending deals
  show "Citizens away — back in ~Nh". Records: docs/diplomacy.md
  (Stage 2 as-built).

**Diplomacy Stage 1 (the builder's-path spine):**
- `RelationsState {NONE, OPEN, PACT}` per (player, faction) in
  `DiplomacySavedData` behind the `DiplomacyManager` sole door (every
  standing write via WorldReputationManager, DIPLOMACY reason live).
  DIPLOMACY = OPEN (not band-locked); ALLIANCE = PACT via the
  alliance-pact milestone deal (offered at ALLIED 80+). Collapse:
  standing below WARY shatters relations (per-second check, derived
  purely from Layer-1 standing — the Orc Disaster clamp breaks Clayman
  relations for free).
- Entry: outbound Send-envoy tab button (± 8-gold gift +2, 1-day
  persisted reply, accept floor standing ≥ 20) + inbound
  `FactionEnvoyTag` Villager envoys (10%/day, min standing 40, 3-day
  cooldown), race-gated via `sendsEnvoysToHuman/Majin` on
  FactionProfile + isMajinSide (Holy bloc never sends to majin).
  `isDiplomacyClosed` is the first entry check.
- Deals: `DealSpec` registry (sealed Requirement: SupplyItems /
  BuildingLevel / Population / Happiness; LendCitizens = Stage 2 seam)
  + persisted `ActiveDeal` (ACTIVE → AWAITING_PAYOFF → READY; deadline
  fail −5). Detection: Deliver-button inventory consume, the existing
  BuildingConstructionModEvent hook + offer-time filter, 1s polls.
  Six starter deals incl. the pact. Movers: +2 open, +4/+6 success,
  +10 pact, −1 offer expiry; decay 0.5/day OPEN / 0.1 PACT, idle days,
  positive earned only. UI: [Roster | Diplomacy] tab strip →
  `DiplomacyScreen` (snapshot/action payloads, live refresh) +
  `FactionEnvoyScreen`. Debug `/diplomacy`. All behind
  `factionSystemEnabled`. Records: docs/diplomacy.md (as-built header).

**Orc Disaster lore event (Layer 2, consuming the faction model):**
- `LoreEvents` = the shared spine (descriptor map + `EncounterFactory`
  seam, nightfall trigger per online player, provocation arming via
  `isProvoked`, soft-influence roll `10% + 30%×hostility` — NO hard rep
  gate, recurrence + resolution consequences). The Orc Disaster plugs
  the raid engine in: `TensuraRaidEvent` gained NBT-optional
  `loreEventId`/`leadBossUuid` (absent = generic raid); a MARKED Geld
  ("Clayman's Orc Disaster") leads orc fodder + offense-scaled Orc Lord
  heavies; boss bar bound to Geld's HP; killing Geld breaks the horde
  (poof-flee + colony +8). The Layer-1 marked-kill fan-out fires the
  two-sided ripple automatically; the lore layer adds the
  forced-HOSTILE clamp + the RECOVERABLE diplomacy-closed flag (mending
  ritual deferred to the diplomacy build) + flavor. Timeout → 8-day
  cooldown; slain → never recurs; offense resets either way. Whole
  event behind `factionSystemEnabled`. Debug: `/tensuraraid disaster`.
  Charybdis/Ifrit deferred as future EncounterFactory plug-ins.
  Records: docs/lore-events.md (as-built header).

**Faction model v1 (expanded world-reputation spine):**
- Per-player × boss-faction standing is now `effective = clamp(liveBase
  + earnedDelta)`: the base comes from `FactionProfile` dispositions ×
  the player's CURRENT race side (5-step majin/human classifier over
  Tensura's Alignment + race tags + our shipped `human_side` race tag),
  so race changes shift the world's posture live. Stored value = earned
  delta (default 0).
- MARKED bosses only (`FactionMarkTag` attachment + faction-colored
  title): a marked kill fans out two-sided through
  `WorldReputationManager.applyMarkedBossKill` — victim faction
  −30×importance (KEYSTONE/MAJOR/NOTABLE/MINOR), allies −50% of that,
  enemies +40%, each × the target's swing multiplier. Attacks (−3×w,
  deduped) don't ripple. Wild/unmarked boss kills: zero faction effect
  (colony +10 + envoy unlocks unchanged). Offense ledger (+10/+1 ×w,
  no decay) + derived per-faction provocation thresholds.
- Config: `factionSystemEnabled` (default true) — whole faction layer
  dormant when off, colony-level systems untouched; `enableAssassins`
  is the separate assassin kill-switch. Debug: expanded `/worldrep`
  (base/earned/effective/offense/provoked) + `/worldrep mark`.
  Records: docs/faction-model.md (as-built header), decisions.md.

**Raid system v1:**
- Reputation-triggered Tensura raids: nightfall + tier below NEUTRAL →
  chance roll (WARY 15% / PASSIVEAGGRESSIVE 30% / HOSTILE 50%), 3-day
  cooldown. `TensuraRaidEvent implements IColonyRaidEvent` registered in
  MC's `colonyeventtypes` registry (citizen flee/hide + persistence free);
  mobs are plain Tensura MONSTER types (guards auto-engage) steered via
  WALK_TARGET + SmartBrainLib target assist. Single wave, boss bar,
  one-night timer. Victory → `modifyReputation(+8, RAID_REPELLED)`.
- Magicule barrier block: fueled BlockEntity (100k), cylinder field r=16,
  EP-scaled contact drain (`BARRIER_DRAIN_COEFFICIENT_PER_SECOND = 0.02`),
  player-magicule channel + magic-crystal refuel, falls at 0.
- Debug: `/tensuraraid`, `/tensuraraid end`. Records:
  `docs/raid-system.md`, decisions.md → "Raid system v1".

**Pending:**
- Stage G6 — orc lord and orc disaster as separate shadow types in the
  citizen pipeline. Currently blocked from naming/send via
  `Races.isBlocked`.
- Higher evolved goblin tiers (Enlightened Hobgoblin, Hobgoblin
  Saint). Currently both render with the hobgoblin scale + assets;
  finer per-tier differentiation lives here.

**Open future-work notes recorded in decisions.md:**
- Multi-colony policy for pending pool drain and colony lookup.
- Equalisation between Tensura stats and MineColonies citizen skills.
- Per-race stat profiles (the picker menu currently shows placeholder
  stat blurbs `[placeholder stats]` until real stats land).
- Subordinate-mob-attacks-citizens targeting bug (out of scope of the
  picker menu work; flagged for separate investigation). Investigated
  2026-06-06 — see [docs/subordinate-citizen-targeting.md](docs/subordinate-citizen-targeting.md)
  for the root cause and the recommended fix (a ManasCore
  `LIVING_CHANGE_TARGET` listener that vetoes citizens of the owner's
  colony). No code written yet.
